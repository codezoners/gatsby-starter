A third year BA (Hons) User-Experience and User-Interface (UX/UI) Designer student at Ravensbourne University London. Passionate about creating meaningful experiences through design, I thoroughly enjoy taking ownership of my work and delivering innovative, User-Centered, efficient and effective solutions. Known for my excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to multi-task and prioritise effectively under pressure, meeting demanding deadlines. Strong communicator, resilient and flexible to work both independently and as part of a team, I like innovation and thrive in environments that embrace new technologies.
