 <a href="https://expressionalwriting.netlify.app">Expressional writing</a> is
  an experiment in interaction; an experiment in using the human face as an input device. 


  </br>Using <b>Face-api.js,</b> this program recognises the expression being made by the user in front of their computer and uses the detected expression, their estimated age, and gender to write out a unique story.
